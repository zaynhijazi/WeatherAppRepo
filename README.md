# WeatherApp

## Overview
WeatherApp is a web application that provides the current weather for any zip code in the United States. It utilizes two APIs to gather data:

- [Zippopotamus API](https://api.zippopotam.us/): This API is used to retrieve city, state, latitude, and longitude information for a given zip code.
- [Open-Meteo API](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo): This API is used to fetch current weather details.
